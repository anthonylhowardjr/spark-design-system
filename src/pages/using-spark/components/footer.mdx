# Footer

The Footer component provides a consistent
place to display secondary content, navigation,
and site information.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="footer--default-story"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Nearly all applications should have a
Footer at the bottom of every page. An
example of an exception would be a
marketing landing page with a unique design.

### Guidelines

- The Global Links section is for
linking to our Sister Companies.
- The Local Links section is for
links to pages or resources within
the same application.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy
