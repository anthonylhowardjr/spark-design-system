# Dictionary

The Dictionary component displays a list of key-value pairs.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="dictionary--default-story"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use the Dictionary component when you have a small
set of data that you want to display using key-value
pairs. If you have a large set of data or more than
one value per key, consider using the Table component
instead. 

### Guidelines

- There should be at least two key-value pairs. 
- The length of the text in a key should not
exceed two lines of wrapped text. 
- A Dictionary cannot be nested within another Dictionary. 

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Basic Dictionary

Use the Basic Dictionary when there are fewer than ten rows.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="dictionary--default-story"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Striped Dictionary

Use the Striped Dictionary when the number of rows is
greater than ten or when the Dictionary is wide enough
to need an additional visual cue. 

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="dictionary--striped"
  maxWidth="100%"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

## Anatomy

- Each row of a Dictionary contains a key on
the left and a value on the right. 
- On small viewports, the value is displayed
below the key.
