# Card

Card is a flexible container
for grouping small chunks of related content.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="card--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Card provides a way to present
information quickly. While
flexible in nature, they will
typically have a heading and
a call to action and be used in
groups within a grid.

### Guidelines

- The content arrangement inside of a Card is intentionally flexible.
- Card has a maximum width of `425px`.
Using Card as full-width containers should be avoided.
- The Standout style can be applied to any Card variant.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Base

Base Card is a simple container for
related content. There are no strict
guidelines about what can go into a
Card, but a clear heading and
call to action are encouraged.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="card--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Standout

Standout Card is used to give
visual priority to a Card.
Any Card can have this style,
but only one card should use it at a
time on the same page.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="card--standout"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Highlighted Header

Highlighted Header Card supplies a
small burst of information that
draws focus to its header.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="card--highlighted-header"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Teaser

Teaser Card includes an
image or illustration and a
call to action that can be
a [Button](/using-spark/components/button) or a [Link](/using-spark/components/link).

- When using an Icon in Teaser Card, the
content of the Card should be center aligned.
- The Teaser Card element order can
be changed, for example, if youâ€™d
like the heading to appear above the image.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="card--teaser"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>
