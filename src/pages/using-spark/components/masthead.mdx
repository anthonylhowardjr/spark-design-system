# Masthead

The Masthead component provides a consistent
way to convey brand identity. It contains the
logo and navigation elements for the application.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="masthead--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  maxWidth="100%"
  minHeight="20rem"
/>

### Usage

Nearly all applications should have a Masthead
at the top of every page. An example of an
exception would be a marketing landing page
with a unique design.

On wide viewports, the Masthead is fixed to the
top of the screen. As the user scrolls, content
moves under the Masthead. On narrow viewports,
when the user scrolls, the Masthead moves off
the top of the screen. When the user scrolls back
up the page, the Masthead returns into view
for easy access.

### Guidelines

- There is room for flexibility inside of
the Masthead so you can combine navigation
with other functionality (e.g. search, phone
numbers, settings, etc.). Avoid trying to
add too many additional features that may
overwhelm or confuse the user.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

### Default Masthead

The Default Masthead is the most compact
way to convey brand identity and provide
basic navigation and other features.
- The number of navigation items that
can be used in the Default Masthead is
only limited by what can fit on a single
row on wide viewports.
- When the number of navigation items is
too large to fit in one row, the Extended
Masthead must be used instead.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="masthead--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  maxWidth="100%"
  minHeight="20rem"
/>

### Extended Masthead

The Extended Masthead moves the navigation
items to a separate row. This allows for
more navigation items to be used and
additional features to be added to the first row.
- The number of navigation items in the Extended
Masthead should be a minimum of 3 and maximum of 6.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="masthead--extended"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  maxWidth="100%"
  minHeight="20rem"
/>

## Anatomy

- Masthead must have a logo
- Masthead may include navigation
- Masthead has space for optional features
e.g. phone number, sign in button, account menu,
account selector, etc.
