# Toggle

Toggle shows and hides a block of content.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="toggle--default-story"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
/>

### Usage

Use Toggle when you need to toggle the
visibility of a block of content. For
example, a disclaimer. 

### Guidelines

- By default, Toggle content is hidden,
so high-priority content should be avoided. 
- If you are using several Toggle components
in succession, consider the
[Accordion](/using-spark/components/accordion) component. 
- The content within a Toggle should be kept
short and relevant to its context for maximum usability. 
- Keep the text of the Toggle trigger short. 

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Anatomy

- A Toggle component must have an element that
triggers visibility of the Toggle content.
- A Toggle component must have a content area.
